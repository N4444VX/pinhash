# pinhash
bash scripts for generating md5 hashes of PIN numbers
All provided hashes are UNSALTED, pure hashes of the PIN digits.
In the provided .txt files, the PINs were hashed without "\n"(new line) appended to the PIN.
To hash a PIN with the "\n"(new line) intact, remove the -n option on the echo command in the script and run it yourself.
